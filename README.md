Exercises: ERC20 Short Attack In this Exercise we are going to be learning what is ERC20 short attack and how to protect smart contracts from it. This kind of attack was discovered by Golem Project experts. In April of 2017 they discovered a security bug affecting some exchanges. When certain exchanges processed transactions of ERC20 tokens, input validation was not being performed on account address length. The result was malformed input data being provided to the contract’s transfer function, and a subsequent underflow condition that manipulated the amount being sent. The impact was that an attacker could potentially rob an exchange account of tokens. This exercise is based on original Golem team article “How to Find $10M Just by Reading the Blockchain” https://blog.golemproject.net/how-to-find-10m-by-just-reading-blockchain-6ae9d39fcd95 and Eric Rafaloff`s article “Analyzing the ERC20 Short Address Attack” https://ericrafaloff.com/analyzing-the-erc20-short-address-attack/. Thanks to the original authors.
